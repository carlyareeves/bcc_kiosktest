Each vivid image features a handcrafted sculptural costume, allowing the wearer to represent themselves in spectacular ways while simultaneously retaining their anonymity. Together, the works celebrate self-expression, resilience, and the power of chosen visibility.  MoB\u2019s Artist in Residence program is supported by Tim Fairfax AC. Presented by Museum of Brisbane in partnership with MELT Festival, Brisbane Powerhouse. \u00a0  Museum of Brisbane is Brisbane City Council\u2019s leading history and art museum where you can experience our city\u2019s vibrant culture.",
